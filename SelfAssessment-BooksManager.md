### Self Assessment
I think overall it went well. It wasn't too dificult to understand what I needed to do and my team was willing to help when I was confused with stuff.

### Code improvements
I refactored the given code to handle books separately in it's own .jsx file and made sure it uses .map for the list. The book page is also now able to handle 3 arguments instead of 2 for title, autor and year. I also noticed the delete button looked a bit silly so I edited the .css file to have the border radius be 4px like all the other elements instead of 50%, which made it look like a weird almond.

### Lessons learned
I think most importantly I learned how to work with github and pushing and pulling correctly and working with the branching.
